# Portfolio Website - GitHub Description

A modern, interactive portfolio website showcasing software engineering and data science projects. Built to demonstrate full-stack development capabilities while providing an engaging way for visitors to explore my work through an AI-powered chatbot.

## Why I Built It

Traditional portfolios are static and one-way. I wanted to create something interactive that could answer questions about my background, projects, and skills in real-time. This portfolio serves as both a showcase of my technical abilities and a practical demonstration of building production-ready applications with modern web technologies.

## Technical Highlights

Built with Next.js 15 (App Router) and React 19, featuring TypeScript for type safety. The centerpiece is ShubhGPT—an AI chatbot powered by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash that provides context-aware responses about my experience, projects, and skills using a comprehensive 550+ line knowledge base. The site includes a dynamic project showcase with multi-tag filtering, full-text search, and individual blog pages with markdown rendering. Styled with Tailwind CSS 4 using a custom beige/brown design system, the application is fully responsive and optimized for performance. Security features include input validation, rate limiting, bot detection, and comprehensive security headers. The architecture uses Next.js API routes for serverless functions, with optimized image loading, code splitting, and static generation where possible.

## Key Features

- AI chatbot with automatic project linking
- Dynamic project filtering and search
- Markdown-based blog system

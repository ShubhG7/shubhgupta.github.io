          title: 'Data Collection Process',
          content: `### Hand Detection and Preprocessing

The data collection script (\`dataCollection.py\`) is designed to capture and preprocess sign language gestures for training the machine learning model. Here's how it works:

\`\`\`python
# Key components of the data collection process
detector = HandDetector(maxHands=1)  # Detects single hand
imgWhite = np.ones((imgSize, imgSize, 3), np.uint8) * 255  # White background
\`\`\`

### Image Standardization

The system implements sophisticated image preprocessing to ensure consistent training data:

1. **Bounding Box Detection**: Extracts hand region with offset padding
2. **Aspect Ratio Handling**: Maintains proportions for both portrait and landscape orientations
3. **Image Resizing**: Standardizes all images to 300x300 pixels
4. **Centering**: Places hand gestures in the center of a white background

### Data Organization

The collected data is organized in the \`data/\` directory with subdirectories for each gesture:
- Each gesture has hundreds of training images
- Images are timestamped for unique identification
- Consistent naming convention: \`Image_{timestamp}.jpg\``

          title: 'Real-Time Detection System',
          content: `### Core Detection Pipeline

The main detection script (\`test.py\`) implements a real-time pipeline:

1. **Video Capture**: Uses webcam for live video feed
2. **Hand Detection**: Identifies and tracks hand movements
3. **Image Preprocessing**: Applies the same standardization as training data
4. **Classification**: Uses trained Keras model to predict gestures
5. **Feedback**: Provides visual and audio output

### Machine Learning Integration

\`\`\`python
classifier = Classifier("Model/keras_model.h5", "Model/labels.txt")
prediction, index = classifier.getPrediction(imgWhite, draw=False)
\`\`\`

The system uses a pre-trained Keras model (\`keras_model.h5\`) that has been trained on thousands of sign language images. The model outputs confidence scores and predicted class indices.

### Visual Feedback System

The detection system provides comprehensive visual feedback:

- **Bounding Box**: Highlights detected hand region
- **Label Display**: Shows predicted gesture above the hand
- **Confidence Visualization**: Displays prediction confidence
- **Real-time Processing**: Updates predictions continuously

### Audio Feedback Integration

Every 20 frames, the system provides audio feedback:

\`\`\`python
if ok%20==0:
    text = labels[index]
    sound = gtts.gTTS(text, lang="en")
    sound.save("sign1.mp3")
    playsound.playsound("sign1.mp3")
\`\`\`

This creates a seamless user experience where users receive both visual and audio confirmation of detected gestures.`

- Basic greetings (hello, thank you)
- Common responses (yes, no, sorry)
- Complex phrases (nice to meet you, what is your name)
- Emotional expressions (I don't like it, why are you sad)`

          content: `ACO is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. Ants communicate through pheromone trails, which help them find efficient paths to food sources.

### How ACO Works

1. **Pheromone Initialization**: Initialize pheromone levels on all edges
2. **Ant Construction**: Each ant builds a tour by probabilistically choosing the next city
3. **Pheromone Update**: Update pheromone levels based on tour quality
4. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 2-3 for multiple iterations

### Key Components

#### 1. Probability Calculation
The probability of an ant moving from city i to city j is calculated using:

\`\`\`python
P(i,j) = [œÑ(i,j)^Œ± √ó Œ∑(i,j)^Œ≤] / Œ£[œÑ(i,k)^Œ± √ó Œ∑(i,k)^Œ≤]
\`\`\`

Where:
- **œÑ(i,j)** = pheromone level on edge (i,j)
- **Œ∑(i,j)** = heuristic information (1/distance)
- **Œ±** = pheromone importance parameter
- **Œ≤** = heuristic importance parameter

#### 2. Pheromone Update
After all ants complete their tours, pheromone levels are updated:

\`\`\`python
œÑ(i,j) = (1-œÅ) √ó œÑ(i,j) + Œ£ŒîœÑ(i,j)
\`\`\`

Where:
- **œÅ** = evaporation rate
- **ŒîœÑ(i,j)** = pheromone deposited by ants that used edge (i,j)

#### 3. Pheromone Deposition
The amount of pheromone deposited by an ant is inversely proportional to the tour length:

\`\`\`python
ŒîœÑ(i,j) = Q / L
\`\`\`

Where:
- **Q** = pheromone constant
- **L** = tour length`

          content: `### Interactive Visualization

The project includes a PyGame-based visualization that shows:

1. **City Locations**: Cities represented as points on a 2D plane
2. **Ant Movement**: Real-time visualization of ant tours
3. **Pheromone Trails**: Visual representation of pheromone levels
4. **Best Tour**: Highlighting of the current best solution
5. **Progress Metrics**: Display of iteration count and best tour length

### Performance Comparison

| Algorithm | Average Tour Length | Standard Deviation | Convergence Time |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Cheapest Link | 245.3 | 12.4 | 0.1s |
| ACO (50 ants) | 198.7 | 8.9 | 2.3s |
| ACO (100 ants) | 195.2 | 6.1 | 4.7s |
| ACO (200 ants) | 193.8 | 4.8 | 9.1s |

### Key Observations

1. **ACO consistently outperforms the greedy algorithm** by 15-20%
2. **Larger ant colonies** provide better solutions but require more computation time
3. **Pheromone evaporation** prevents premature convergence to local optima
4. **Parameter tuning** significantly affects algorithm performance

### Parameter Sensitivity

The performance of ACO depends heavily on the following parameters:

- **Œ± (alpha)**: Controls pheromone importance (typically 1-2)
- **Œ≤ (beta)**: Controls heuristic importance (typically 2-5)
- **œÅ (rho)**: Evaporation rate (typically 0.1-0.3)
- **Q**: Pheromone constant (typically 1-100)`

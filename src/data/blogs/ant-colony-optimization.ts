      content: `The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most famous and challenging problems in computer science and operations research. Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

In this project, we explore two different approaches to solve the TSP:
1. **Cheapest Link Algorithm** - A simple greedy approach
2. **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** - A sophisticated metaheuristic inspired by ant behavior`

      title: 'The Problem',
      content: `The TSP is an NP-hard problem, meaning that as the number of cities grows, the computational complexity increases exponentially. For small instances, we can find the optimal solution, but for larger problems, we need to rely on approximation algorithms and metaheuristics.`

      title: 'Approach 1: Cheapest Link Algorithm',
      content: `The Cheapest Link Algorithm is a simple greedy approach that works as follows:

1. Start at the first city
2. At each step, find the unvisited city that is closest to the current city
3. Move to that city and mark it as visited
4. Repeat until all cities are visited
5. Return to the starting city

**Advantages:**
- Simple to understand and implement
- Fast execution
- Guaranteed to find a solution

**Disadvantages:**
- Often produces suboptimal solutions
- Can get stuck in local optima
- No mechanism to escape poor initial choices`

      id: 'approach-2-aco',
      title: 'Approach 2: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)',
      content: `ACO is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. Ants communicate through pheromone trails, which help them find efficient paths to food sources.

### How ACO Works

1. **Pheromone Initialization**: Initialize pheromone levels on all edges
2. **Ant Construction**: Each ant builds a tour by probabilistically choosing the next city
3. **Pheromone Update**: Update pheromone levels based on tour quality
4. **Iteration**: Repeat steps 2-3 for multiple iterations

### Key Components

#### 1. Probability Calculation
The probability of an ant moving from city i to city j is calculated using:

\`\`\`python
P(i,j) = [τ(i,j)^α × η(i,j)^β] / Σ[τ(i,k)^α × η(i,k)^β]
\`\`\`

Where:
- **τ(i,j)** = pheromone level on edge (i,j)
- **η(i,j)** = heuristic information (1/distance)
- **α** = pheromone importance parameter
- **β** = heuristic importance parameter

#### 2. Pheromone Update
After all ants complete their tours, pheromone levels are updated:

\`\`\`python
τ(i,j) = (1-ρ) × τ(i,j) + ΣΔτ(i,j)
\`\`\`

Where:
- **ρ** = evaporation rate
- **Δτ(i,j)** = pheromone deposited by ants that used edge (i,j)

#### 3. Pheromone Deposition
The amount of pheromone deposited by an ant is inversely proportional to the tour length:

\`\`\`python
Δτ(i,j) = Q / L
\`\`\`

Where:
- **Q** = pheromone constant
- **L** = tour length`

5. **Progress Metrics**: Display of iteration count and best tour length

### Performance Comparison

| Algorithm | Average Tour Length | Standard Deviation | Convergence Time |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Cheapest Link | 245.3 | 12.4 | 0.1s |
| ACO (50 ants) | 198.7 | 8.9 | 2.3s |
| ACO (100 ants) | 195.2 | 6.1 | 4.7s |
| ACO (200 ants) | 193.8 | 4.8 | 9.1s |

### Key Observations

1. **ACO consistently outperforms the greedy algorithm** by 15-20%
2. **Larger ant colonies** provide better solutions but require more computation time
3. **Pheromone evaporation** prevents premature convergence to local optima
4. **Parameter tuning** significantly affects algorithm performance

### Parameter Sensitivity

The performance of ACO depends heavily on the following parameters:

- **α (alpha)**: Controls pheromone importance (typically 1-2)
- **β (beta)**: Controls heuristic importance (typically 2-5)
- **ρ (rho)**: Evaporation rate (typically 0.1-0.3)
- **Q**: Pheromone constant (typically 1-100)`

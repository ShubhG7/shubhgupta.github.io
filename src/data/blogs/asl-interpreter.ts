      content: `Sign language is a crucial form of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, yet many people struggle to understand it. This project demonstrates how computer vision and machine learning can bridge this communication gap by creating a real-time sign language detection system. The system can recognize 10 different sign language gestures and provide both visual and audio feedback, making communication more accessible.`

      content: `This sign language detection system is built using Python and leverages several key technologies:
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for real-time video processing
- **Hand Detection**: CVZone's HandTrackingModule for accurate hand recognition
- **Machine Learning**: Keras model for gesture classification
- **Text-to-Speech**: Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for audio feedback

      title: 'System Architecture',
      content: `### Core Components

The project consists of three main Python scripts that work together to create a comprehensive sign language detection system:

1. **Data Collection Module** (\`dataCollection.py\`)
2. **Real-Time Detection Module** (\`test.py\`)
3. **Voice-to-Sign Converter** (\`voicetotext.py\`)

### Supported Gestures

The system currently recognizes 10 American Sign Language (ASL) gestures:
- Hello
- I Love You
- No
- Go
- Yes
- Like
- Promise
- All The Best
- Peace
- Wrong`
    },
    {
      id: 'data-collection',
      title: 'Data Collection Process',
      content: `### Hand Detection and Preprocessing

The data collection script (\`dataCollection.py\`) is designed to capture and preprocess sign language gestures for training the machine learning model. Here's how it works:

\`\`\`python
# Key components of the data collection process
detector = HandDetector(maxHands=1)  # Detects single hand
imgWhite = np.ones((imgSize, imgSize, 3), np.uint8) * 255  # White background
\`\`\`

### Image Standardization

The system implements sophisticated image preprocessing to ensure consistent training data:

1. **Bounding Box Detection**: Extracts hand region with offset padding
2. **Aspect Ratio Handling**: Maintains proportions for both portrait and landscape orientations
3. **Image Resizing**: Standardizes all images to 300x300 pixels
4. **Centering**: Places hand gestures in the center of a white background

### Data Organization

The collected data is organized in the \`data/\` directory with subdirectories for each gesture:
- Each gesture has hundreds of training images
- Images are timestamped for unique identification
- Consistent naming convention: \`Image_{timestamp}.jpg\``

      id: 'real-time-detection',
      title: 'Real-Time Detection System',
      content: `### Core Detection Pipeline

The main detection script (\`test.py\`) implements a real-time pipeline:

1. **Video Capture**: Uses webcam for live video feed
2. **Hand Detection**: Identifies and tracks hand movements
3. **Image Preprocessing**: Applies the same standardization as training data
4. **Classification**: Uses trained Keras model to predict gestures
5. **Feedback**: Provides visual and audio output

### Machine Learning Integration

\`\`\`python
classifier = Classifier("Model/keras_model.h5", "Model/labels.txt")
prediction, index = classifier.getPrediction(imgWhite, draw=False)
\`\`\`

The system uses a pre-trained Keras model (\`keras_model.h5\`) that has been trained on thousands of sign language images. The model outputs confidence scores and predicted class indices.

### Visual Feedback System

The detection system provides comprehensive visual feedback:

- **Bounding Box**: Highlights detected hand region
- **Label Display**: Shows predicted gesture above the hand
- **Confidence Visualization**: Displays prediction confidence
- **Real-time Processing**: Updates predictions continuously

### Audio Feedback Integration

Every 20 frames, the system provides audio feedback:

\`\`\`python
if ok%20==0:
    text = labels[index]
    sound = gtts.gTTS(text, lang="en")
    sound.save("sign1.mp3")
    playsound.playsound("sign1.mp3")
\`\`\`

This creates a seamless user experience where users receive both visual and audio confirmation of detected gestures.`

      id: 'voice-to-sign',
      title: 'Voice-to-Sign Language Converter',
      content: `### Reverse Communication

The \`voicetotext.py\` script enables the reverse process - converting spoken words to sign language demonstrations:

1. **Speech Recognition**: Uses Google's speech recognition API
2. **Voice Processing**: Listens for specific commands
3. **Video Playback**: Displays corresponding sign language videos
4. **Interactive Interface**: Allows users to learn signs through voice commands

### Video Database

The system includes a comprehensive video database (\`vids/\` directory) with demonstrations of various signs:
- Basic greetings (hello, thank you)
- Common responses (yes, no, sorry)
- Complex phrases (nice to meet you, what is your name)
- Emotional expressions (I don't like it, why are you sad)`
    },
    {
      id: 'technical-implementation',
      title: 'Technical Implementation Details',
      content: `### Hand Detection Algorithm

The system uses CVZone's HandTrackingModule which is built on MediaPipe:
- **21 Landmark Points**: Tracks key hand positions
- **Real-time Processing**: Processes video at 30+ FPS
- **Robust Detection**: Works in various lighting conditions
- **Single Hand Focus**: Optimized for one-handed gestures

### Image Preprocessing Pipeline

\`\`\`python
# Aspect ratio calculation and resizing
aspectRatio = h/w
if aspectRatio > 1:
    # Portrait orientation handling
    k = imgSize/h
    wCal = math.ceil(k*w)
    imgResize = cv2.resize(imgCrop, (wCal, imgSize))
else:
    # Landscape orientation handling
    k = imgSize/w
    hCal = math.ceil(k*h)
    imgResize = cv2.resize(imgCrop, (imgSize, hCal))
\`\`\`

### Model Architecture

The Keras model (\`keras_model.h5\`) is trained on:
- **Input Size**: 300x300x3 RGB images
- **Output Classes**: 10 different sign language gestures
- **Training Data**: Thousands of preprocessed hand gesture images
- **Optimization**: Optimized for real-time inference`

      content: `### Price Distribution
The dataset shows a wide range of property prices, from affordable options to luxury properties. The price distribution is right-skewed, which is typical for real estate markets where most properties are in the mid-range, with fewer high-end luxury properties.

### Location Impact
With 413 unique locations, the dataset captures Mumbai's diverse neighborhoods, from affordable areas like Kharghar to premium locations. Location encoding was performed to convert categorical location data into numerical features for machine learning.

### Amenities Analysis
The dataset includes 13 different amenities, with most properties having basic amenities like lift availability and car parking. Premium amenities like swimming pools and clubhouses are less common, indicating their impact on property pricing.`

      title: 'Data Preprocessing',
      content: `### Handling Missing Values
The dataset was relatively clean with minimal missing values, which were handled using median imputation to maintain data integrity.

### Feature Engineering
- **Location Encoding**: Categorical location data was converted to numerical values
- **Price Transformation**: Box-Cox transformation was applied to normalize the price distribution, improving model performance

### Data Splitting
The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, ensuring proper model evaluation while maintaining representative samples of different property types and locations.`

      content: `### Model Selection
Three different machine learning algorithms were tested:

1. **Linear Regression**: Baseline model for comparison
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**: Non-linear model with interpretable rules
3. **Random Forest Regressor**: Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees

### Pipeline Implementation
A comprehensive machine learning pipeline was created using scikit-learn, including:
- **Imputation**: Handling missing values with median strategy
- **Standardization**: Scaling features to have zero mean and unit variance
- **Model Training**: Fitting the selected algorithm`

      content: `### Cross-Validation Results

| Model | Mean RMSE | Standard Deviation |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Linear Regression | 0.0340 | 0.0007 |
| Decision Tree | 0.0259 | 0.0015 |
| **Random Forest** | **0.0196** | **0.0013** |

### Key Findings

**Random Forest Regressor** emerged as the best performing model with:
- Lowest mean RMSE (0.0196)
- Consistent performance across cross-validation folds
- Good balance between bias and variance

The Random Forest model's superior performance can be attributed to:
- **Non-linear relationships**: Real estate pricing involves complex interactions between features
- **Feature importance**: Random Forest can identify which amenities and characteristics most influence pricing
- **Robustness**: Less prone to overfitting compared to single decision trees`

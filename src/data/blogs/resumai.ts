      content: `As part of the ResumAI development team, I had the privilege of contributing to the architecture and implementation of a comprehensive Applicant Tracking System (ATS) that bridges the gap between traditional recruitment processes and modern AI-powered solutions. This project represents a significant milestone in our team's journey to create intelligent, user-centric recruitment software that serves both applicants and recruiters.

**ResumAI** is a full-stack web application designed to revolutionize the hiring process through intelligent resume analysis and automated candidate matching. Built with modern technologies and microservices architecture, the system provides distinct experiences for two primary user types:

- **Applicants**: Upload resumes, receive AI-powered analysis, and apply to relevant job postings
- **Recruiters**: Post job listings, receive ranked candidate matches, and manage shortlists efficiently`

      title: "Technical Architecture",
      content: `### Frontend Architecture

Our frontend is built with **React 18** and **TypeScript**, utilizing a component-based architecture that promotes reusability and maintainability. The modular design allows for easy component reuse across different dashboard sections, with Material-UI providing a consistent design system throughout the application.

**Key Frontend Technologies:**
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: For consistent, accessible design system
- **Redux Toolkit**: State management with RTK Query for API calls
- **React Router**: Client-side routing with role-based access control
- **Vite**: Fast build tooling and development server
- **Jest & Testing Library**: Comprehensive testing suite

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a **microservices pattern** with **Fastify** as our primary framework, chosen for its performance and TypeScript support. The plugin-based architecture allows for easy extension and maintenance, with auto-loading capabilities that streamline the development process.

**Backend Technologies:**
- **Fastify**: High-performance web framework
- **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database operations
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with full-text search capabilities
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **Keycloak**: Enterprise-grade authentication and authorization

### Database Design

Our database schema was carefully designed to support complex recruitment workflows using Prisma ORM. The schema includes comprehensive models for users, job listings, resumes, applications, and shortlists, with proper relationships and constraints. The design supports multi-tenant user management, file storage and resume tracking, job posting and application workflows, AI-powered resume matching, and recruiter shortlisting functionality.`

      title: "Core Features & Implementation",
      content: `### 1. AI-Powered Resume Analysis

One of our most challenging features was implementing intelligent resume analysis. The system provides three key scoring metrics:

- **Impact Score**: Measures the strength of achievements and quantifiable results
- **Presentation Score**: Evaluates formatting, structure, and professional appearance
- **Competency Score**: Assesses skills alignment with job requirements

The resume analysis workflow involves file upload, processing through our AI engine, and storing the results with scoring metrics. The system handles multiple file formats and provides real-time feedback to users during the analysis process.

### 2. Role-Based Dashboard Experience

We implemented distinct user experiences based on authentication groups:

**Applicant Dashboard:**
- Resume upload and analysis
- Job search and application tracking
- Personal analytics and insights
- Resume score tracking over time

**Recruiter Dashboard:**
- Job posting management
- Candidate shortlisting tools
- Analytics and reporting
- Application review workflows

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

We chose **Keycloak** for enterprise-grade security. Our authentication system uses Keycloak for enterprise-grade security, implementing JWT token validation and role-based access control. The middleware validates tokens on protected routes and assigns appropriate user permissions based on their group membership.

### 4. File Management System

Implemented a robust file upload system with:
- **Multi-format support** (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- **Secure storage** with unique URL generation
- **File validation** and virus scanning
- **Progress tracking** for large uploads`

      title: "Development Challenges & Solutions",
      content: `### 1. State Management Complexity

**Challenge**: Managing complex application state across multiple user roles and workflows.

**Solution**: Implemented Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for efficient API state management, providing centralized API service with automatic caching, request deduplication, and type-safe endpoints.

### 2. Real-time Data Synchronization

**Challenge**: Keeping dashboard analytics and job listings synchronized across multiple users.

**Solution**: Implemented optimistic updates with rollback capabilities and Redis caching for frequently accessed data.

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Challenge**: Handling large datasets of resumes and job applications efficiently.

**Solutions**:
- **Pagination** and **virtual scrolling** for data grids
- **Database indexing** on frequently queried fields
- **Redis caching** for expensive computations
- **Lazy loading** of dashboard components

### 4. Cross-browser Compatibility

**Challenge**: Ensuring consistent experience across different browsers and devices.

**Solution**: Comprehensive testing with BrowserStack and progressive enhancement techniques.`

      content: `### Containerization Strategy

We implemented a **Docker-based** development environment. Our containerization strategy uses Docker Compose to orchestrate PostgreSQL, Redis, and Keycloak services, providing a consistent development environment across all team members.

### CI/CD Pipeline

- **Automated testing** on every commit
- **Docker image building** and registry management
- **Environment-specific deployments**
- **Database migration automation**

## Testing Strategy

### Frontend Testing

Our frontend testing strategy uses Jest and Testing Library to ensure component reliability and user interaction accuracy. We implement comprehensive unit tests for all major components and integration tests for critical user workflows.

### Backend Testing

- **Unit tests** for business logic
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- **Database migration tests**
- **Authentication flow testing**

## Performance Metrics

Our implementation achieved impressive performance benchmarks:

- **Page Load Time**: < 2 seconds for dashboard
- **API Response Time**: < 200ms for most endpoints
- **Database Query Performance**: Optimized with proper indexing
- **File Upload**: Support for files up to 50MB with progress tracking`
